# Arc Diagram #

This demo shows how to generate an arc diagram using [D3](http://d3js.org/). It is still a work in progress.

The dataset is the same one from the Les Mis√©rables demos [[1]](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/miserables/) [[2]](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4062045) provided in the [D3 Gallery](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery).

## TO DO ##

- Update to use [reusable chart](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/chart/) approach.
- Update to work with directed graphs (some arcs above, some below).
